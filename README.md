Acknowledging some inspirations I took from others:

- Theme for the blog and resume pages inspired by https://www.vincentprouillet.com.
- Idea for having links to the post shared on social medias instead having comments section, blog scheme, and revision history inspired by https://thesquareplanet.com
- Home page inspired by https://thorstenball.com/
- Theme toggle without JS inspired by https://tymekdev.github.io/no-js-dark-mode-toggle/
