<p>Novo server, novo tema, novo idioma. Como a maioria dos assuntos em tecnologia é publicado em inglês e eu preciso praticar mais, vou estar tentando escrever alguns posts em inglês. Se vocês notarem qualquer erro, por favor me avisem :).</p>

<h3>Why change?</h3>
<p>I was using a common host on TeHospedo, but sometimes I needed some configurations or process that was not in my hands, I had to ask to support do that for me. Some tasks were not solve fast as I would like and it is so frustrating that I decided move to a new server on <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/" target="_blank">Digital Ocean</a> that provide virtual machines with many Linux distributions options. Take a look on their advertising video:</p>

<h3>My Droplet (Virtual Machine)</h3>
<p>My VM is a Linux CentOS 6.4 x64 with 512 MB RAM and 20GB SSD. This is amazing for my needs and I will can install, configure and run anything there as I prefer.</p>
<h3>Configuring the Server</h3>
<p>My main reason for have this server nowadays is to host my wordpress blog and also my brother’s blog2. So for run the wordpress I had to configure the LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL and PHP). As unfortunately I have little experience with that configurations on Linux, I followed some good tutorials provided by Digital Ocean:</p>

<p>Many configurations right? But I configured exactly as I want and I don't depend wait for any staff support to install or configure a new feature in my host.</p>
