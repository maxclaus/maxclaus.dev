title = "LXC + Docker"

In October I gave a presentation at Bravi about LXC + Docker. Since I was working hard in project at that time I almost forgot to post my presentation here.

I would like had included some descriptions about the presentation to make the slides more self explanatory. But is almost Christmas and I'm a bit lazy write down anything right now. Sorry ;(

But I recorded this presentation. I will try to included the video here later.

- The images of the first part were took from Ben _Golub - Docker Presentation_.
- The images about Docker images and containers were took from _Docker documentation_.
