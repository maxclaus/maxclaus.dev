I am starting 2025 with a new website and a new employment status.

First, about the website, many years ago I had a blog that used [Jekyll][jekyll] static site generator (SSG) to generate html from markdown files. However, I eventually gave up maintaining it and moved to Medium. While it did bring my posts to broader audience, I always thought about moving back to my self-hosted blog at some point. That time has finally come. After struggling Ruby dependency issues from [Jekyll][jekyll] for a while, I decided switch to [Zola][zola], a static site generator written in Rust. Since Zola is released as a single binary, dependency issues should not be a problem anymore.

Second, the company I worked for over the past eight years shut down on December 31, 2024. As of the time of writing this post, I am currently unemployed. I might write in future posts about what a great experience it was working for [InVision][invision], the things I learned there, and how the shutdown process unfolded. For now, my main goal is to find a new remote job.
