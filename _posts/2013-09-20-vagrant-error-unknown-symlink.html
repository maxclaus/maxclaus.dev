<p>Why does with Windows always has a problem or is more difficult to work with nice non-Microsoft stuff?! I was configuring Vagrant to run a project with Nodejs. Everything was going really well when my host machine was the Mac. But when I had to use the Windows as host machine then I got my first problem to run the command npm install inside the guest Ubuntu machine:</p>
<pre class="brush: shell">Error: UNKNOWN, symlink</pre>
<p>After some attempts the only solution that works was use a parameter to not force use symlink when installing npm dependencies:</p>
<pre class="brush: shell">sudo npm install --no-bin-link</pre>
<p>Take a look on this <a href="http://www.conroyp.com/2013/04/13/symlink-shenanigans-nodejs-npm-express-vagrant">post</a> to understand better the problem.</p>
