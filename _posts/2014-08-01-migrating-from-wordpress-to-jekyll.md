title: Migrating from Wordpress to Jekyll
---

Today I finally migrated from Wordpress to Jekyll. I was tired using Wordpress 
because that was too much for my needs (`markdown` and `syntax highlight`) and seems be much easier customize the
Jekyll templates.

I just want to thanks **Hadi Hariri**. Following his 
[post](http://hadihariri.com/2013/12/24/migrating-from-wordpress-to-jekyll/) I could easily migrate to Jekyll.
